DOING
* I want to log a food I have eaten by submitting a form with its name, calories and details.
* I want to view a list of only the names of the foods I have logged, and I want to be able to click on a name to view the details and calories for that food.
* I want to view either all foods, only unhealthy foods that are more than 300 calories, or only healthy foods that are less than 300 calories.
* I want to be able to click on a food and then edit its name, details or calories in case I decide to pretend my fries were only 100 calories instead of 365 calories.


* CAN I ADD DAY FOOD IS CONSUMED? CAN I USE MOMENT.JS OR SOMETHING SIMILAR?
