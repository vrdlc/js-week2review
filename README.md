# GitHub User Search Engine

#### _March 17th, 2016_

### By _** Virgilio Ramon de la Cruz **_

## Description

_This web app is designed to allow the user to track food eaten during the day, the calorie count of the food item, and a short description. The user can then filter their list of food by calories and whether or not that food is considered healthy or not._

## Setup/Installation

#### System Requirements

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) w/ [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
2. [Bower](http://bower.io/)
3. [Angular 2](https://angular.io/)
4. [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)

#### Installation

* After cloning the repository, run "npm install" and "bower install" in the terminal. This will install every dependency and package off the manifests in the bower.JSON and package.JSON files.
* Run the following commands to install the following programs on your computer:
  * npm install gulp -g
  * npm install bower -g
  * npm install typescript -g
* From the top level of the cloned directory, run the following commands:
  * gem install sass
  * npm install atom-typescript

* In the terminal, type "gulp build" followed by "gulp serve". This should open a new browser window with a search field.
* Enter the food you have eaten today. Once entered, you can click on a single food item to view and edit its details. Using the dropdown menu, you can also filter food based on its calorie count (more or less than 300 cal).
